          <br>
          <p>When we step out into the world we see an enormous problem that is creating an atmosphere covering the sphere right here. Vapers, smokers, scammers, robbers, global warmers, hijackers, and other atrocious and devastating occupations creating a world full of terror. When do we stand up to eradicate these issues? When do we make the change? When are we going to stop being frightened and take the initiative to create a better world?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>On one side of the world we have a lot of crashing cars, on the other side of the world we have bloody wars. In 1987 we had nuclear contamination now in 2024, we have total inflation! Have you ever wondered when this chaos will end? People are still being driven around the bend. The poor, still having no moolah  in their pockets, and the rich wasting their goods on rockets. Many Heroes have tried to save the world, but the leaders treat them like milk curd. These leaders don't even care about evolution, so watch out `cuz the people might spark a revolution. We must take action and make a different faction, then we protest for a duration, then the government will gain a temptation for a treaty, leading to alteration for inflation and gain emancipation.These problems when added together will silently creep up on us, just like a broken bus, then rapidly embracing us in a cloak of darkness and loss if we don't change.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So when you’ve finished persuading the government to take action , we must do it. Save the world, make everything change. End the scammers, quit the smoking and the vaping. Stop hacking into peoples’ accounts. Ignite your spark and join with other people to create a large fire of hope to fix the world.</p>
